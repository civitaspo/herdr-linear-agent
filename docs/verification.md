# Verification with a real Linear workspace

The test suite runs the ticker and the coordinator's commands against a fake Herdr and an in-memory fake of the Linear API. The questions below depend on how Linear and the agent CLIs behave for real. Check them with a scratch Linear team and a scratch Herdr session before relying on the plugin, and record the results here.

The first integration test ran on 2026-09-26 and 2026-09-27 with Herdr 0.9.1 and Claude Code 2.1.280 on macOS, in a scratch Linear team and a scratch Herdr session, with a sandbox GitHub repository.

## Open questions

| # | Question | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | When a person delegates an issue to an app without a webhook, does Linear create an Agent Session by itself? | **Checked.** Without the "Agent session events" webhook category, Linear refuses every session ("Agent sessions are not enabled for this application"); with it, Linear creates the session on delegation. The plugin uses that session and creates one only when none is open. |
| 2 | Does an `elicitation` activity notify the person who delegated the issue? | Not checked yet. A Herdr notification is also shown when `notifications.herdr` is on. |
| 3 | Can an activity created with our `id` be read back with `activities(filter: { id: { eq } })`? | Not exercised: no write lost its response during the test. |
| 4 | Does `agentSessionUpdate` accept a list for `plan`? | **Checked.** Linear accepts a list of `{content, status}`. |
| 5 | How should Claude Code's trust dialog in a new worktree be handled? | **Checked.** Every new run folder shows the dialog; a worktree does not when its repository's main checkout is already trusted. The plugin detects a dialog and asks for someone in Herdr, and with `claude.auto_accept_trust_dialog = true` it accepts the dialog ahead of time, so no run stopped at it. |
| 6 | Does Codex read `AGENTS.md` in a run folder that is not a git repository, and how do its approvals behave? | Not checked yet; approvals come from the profile's `args`. |
| 7 | Does the Keychain ask for confirmation when the ticker, started by the startup hook, reads the token? After a rebuild? | No confirmation appeared for the ticker, including after several rebuilds, when the credential was created by the same binary path. |
| 8 | What is the complexity of the batched run read (`HlaRuns`) with several runs? | Not measured; the test ran one run at a time. |
| 9 | Does a worker start building before the worktree setup plugin finishes? | Not checked: no setup plugin was installed. |
| 10 | What does `Issue.estimate` return for a team with T-shirt estimates? | Not checked: the test issues had no estimate. |
| 11 | Where does `claude -p --output-format json --json-schema` put the schema-checked JSON? | **Checked.** In `structured_output`, and as text in `result`. One routing call with haiku cost about $0.24, mostly Claude Code's own cached context. |
| 12 | Does Linear report the granted scope with commas or spaces? | **Checked.** Spaces: `"app:assignable read write"`. |
| 13 | Does the Secret Service store work on a Linux desktop and in a headless session (for example over SSH, where no keyring runs)? | Not checked yet. |

## Flows checked end to end

| Flow | Issues | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pick up, route, coordinator, worker, PR, `finish` | THLA-2, THLA-3 | The issue moved to In Progress within seconds of the delegation and to In Review on `finish`; the PR was attached to the session and linked by Linear's GitHub integration. |
| Question and reply | THLA-4 | The coordinator asked in the session; the reply reached `conversation.md` and the coordinator, which then started the worker. |
| Stop | THLA-6 | Both agents were interrupted and the "Stopped" response was posted; the worktree and branch stayed. |
| Close | THLA-2 to THLA-5 | When an issue became Done, its run and workspaces were closed; branches and worktrees stayed. |

## Bugs the test found

| Bug | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Herdr refused the manifest: a link handler needs a `title`. | #22 |
| Login always failed: Linear's space-separated scope did not parse. | #23 |
| No session could be created without the webhook category, and a claim that failed there left the run without a coordinator. | #24 |
| After a stop, an interrupted worker without a report became Idle and the coordinator was nudged back to work. | #28 |
