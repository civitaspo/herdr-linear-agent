[![Release](https://github.com/civitaspo/herdr-linear-agent/actions/workflows/release-tag.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/civitaspo/herdr-linear-agent/actions/workflows/release-tag.yml)

herdr-linear-agent is a [Herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr) plugin that picks up Linear issues delegated to its Linear app user and works on them with AI coding agents running in Herdr panes.

> [!NOTE]
> herdr-linear-agent is not [Linear Agent](https://linear.app/docs/linear-agent), the assistant built into Linear (`@Linear`, ⌘J). It is an independent Herdr plugin, not made by or affiliated with Linear, that connects to your workspace as its own OAuth app through Linear's public Agents API, the same way other third-party agents do.

For each issue, the plugin starts one coordinator agent. The coordinator reads the issue, splits the work, and starts one worker agent per repository in its own Herdr worktree. Workers implement the change, open pull requests and check CI. The plugin reports progress, questions and results to the issue's Agent Session in Linear, and people reply there.

- **Linear is the front door.** Delegate an issue to the app user; talk to the run in the issue's Agent Session. The plugin opens no endpoint and polls Linear; the webhook Linear requires can point at an endpoint that discards what it receives (see [Set up](#set-up)).
- **One writer.** Only the plugin's background ticker writes to Linear. Agents call plugin subcommands that queue requests; they never hold a Linear token.
- **Profiles, not flags.** Agent kind, model, effort and permission flags live in profiles you write in the config. Agents choose a profile by name and nothing else.
- **Limits enforced by the binary.** Concurrent runs, workers per run and total agents are capped by the plugin, not by the agents.
- **Nothing is merged for you.** No merge, no force push, and no issue moved to Done. The plugin moves an issue to a started state when it picks it up and to your review state when the coordinator finishes.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux, and Herdr 0.9.1 or later
- On Linux: a Secret Service provider (GNOME Keyring, KWallet) for the token, and `xdg-open`
- The agent CLIs your profiles use (`claude`, `codex`, `cursor-agent`, ...) and `git`
- One or more Linear workspaces where you can install an OAuth application (workspace admin)

## Set up

1. **Create a Linear OAuth application** (Settings → API → OAuth applications) for this plugin, in each workspace you use. Its name becomes the app user's name: pick one that people cannot mistake for Linear's own `@Linear` (for example `herdr-linear-agent`). Add the callback URL `http://127.0.0.1:43871/oauth/callback` and note the client ID. The plugin uses the authorization code flow with PKCE and never needs the client secret. It installs the app with `actor=app` and the scopes `read`, `write` and `app:assignable`, which creates an app user you can delegate issues to.

   **Add a webhook with the "Agent session events" category, then disable its delivery (required).** Linear enables Agent Sessions for an app only when it subscribes to that category, and without them the plugin cannot pick up any issue ("Agent sessions are not enabled for this application"). The plugin never reads webhooks, since it polls Linear, so nothing needs to receive them: enter any URL, for example `https://example.invalid/linear`, and disable the webhook's delivery so no issue or session content is sent anywhere. Keep the webhook and its category; only the delivery is off. Add it before you log in; an app that was authorized before needs to log in again before the subscription takes effect.
2. **Install the plugin:**

   ```bash
   herdr plugin install civitaspo/herdr-linear-agent
   ```

   The build step downloads the release binary, or builds from source with `cargo` when there is none.
3. **Write the config** at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/herdr-linear-agent/config.toml` (default `~/.config/herdr-linear-agent/config.toml`), and one folder per agent profile under `profiles/` next to it. See [Configuration](#configuration) and [Profiles](#profiles).
4. **Log in:** run the Herdr action **herdr-linear-agent: log in to Linear**. For each workspace without a stored token, it opens the browser, stores the token in the macOS Keychain or, on Linux, the Secret Service (service `dev.herdr-linear-agent.linear.oauth.v1`, one account per workspace named after it), and checks that it acts as the app user; when every workspace has a token, it logs in to all of them again. `herdr-linear-agent action login --workspace <name>` logs in to one workspace again. The browser must run on the same machine: Linear redirects to `127.0.0.1`.
5. **Check the setup:** run **herdr-linear-agent: check setup**.
6. **Delegate an issue** in one of the configured teams to the app user, as a person in the team's `allowed_delegator_ids`.

```

**Reloading the config.** The running ticker keeps the config it started with until you run the Herdr action **herdr-linear-agent: reload the config**. The action checks the config first and shows why it does not load; when it loads, the ticker starts its tasks again with it, as a ticker restart would, and reads the Linear credentials again, so the macOS Keychain may ask once more. The ticker also compares `config.toml` and the profile folders with the ones it runs on every second, by content, and when they changed it shows a Herdr notification (if `notifications.herdr` is on) asking you to reload, or saying why the new files do not load; it tells once per change. A reload takes effect for what is decided and started afterwards: routing of new issues, coordinator and worker launches and restarts, limits and notifications.

- An agent that is running keeps its arguments and instructions; the change reaches it at its next launch or restart. `AGENTS.md` and briefs already written are not rewritten.
- Removing a profile that a running run uses is not refused; restarting or resuming with it fails then with the usual unknown-profile error.
- Lowering a limit below the current count leaves running runs alone; new ones wait until there is room.

**Workspaces and teams.** Each workspace polls Linear with its own OAuth application, token and app user. Runs are named `<workspace>/<ISSUE-KEY>`, for example `acme/DATA-1`, so the same issue key in two workspaces makes two runs; the name is what agents pass to `herdr-linear-agent` commands, and the workspace is part of agent names (`acme-data-1-coordinator`), branches (`herdr-linear-agent/acme/data-1/w1-...`) and brief folders. A team's `allowed_user_ids`, `allowed_delegator_ids` and `review_state` apply to that team's issues only. A run whose team was removed from the config keeps running, relays nobody's replies and moves to `In Review` on `finish`.

**Who may delegate.** The ticker takes an issue only when a person in the team's `allowed_delegator_ids` delegated it; see [Security notes](#security-notes), and [Finding user IDs](#finding-user-ids) for the IDs. Without the key, the team's `allowed_user_ids` may delegate. Set it apart when someone should start runs without their replies counting as instructions, or the other way round.

### Postmortems

To improve how the agents work run after run, a routing can list postmortem profiles: when the coordinator calls `finish` (an interim postmortem) and when the issue is completed or canceled (a final one), an agent reads the run and the plugin posts its summary as a comment on the issue, with the labels it names. A postmortem profile is an ordinary profile: its `instructions.md` is the method, and says which labels to add. Edit it as often as you like; each comment names the profile and the method's version.

```toml
# profiles/postmortem/config.toml: any kind that can be a routing agent
kind = "claude"
model = "haiku"
description = "Reviews a run for what to change in how the agents work"
```

```markdown
<!-- profiles/postmortem/instructions.md -->
- What was asked, and what was delivered.
- What was smooth, and where time went (retries, failed commands, waiting for people).
- What to change next time, concretely.
Add the label `Improvement` only when there is something concrete to change in how the agents work.
```

Then list it in the routing: `postmortems = ["postmortem"]`. Each postmortem, interim or final, picks its profile when it is written: a list with one profile gives that profile; with several, the routing agent picks one from the run's issue, `conversation.md`, workers' reports, PRs and times (not the transcripts), and a failed pick gives the first. The picked profile runs headless the way the routing agent does, with no tools: the plugin gives it the run's records on standard input (the issue, `conversation.md`, the workers' reports, and the agents' transcripts, long ones shortened in the middle), and it answers with the summary and the labels. The plugin keeps each answer in the run folder (`.state/postmortems/`), posts the comment, and adds the labels that exist in Linear (it creates none). A comment reads `**Postmortem (interim)**, method `postmortem` version `<12 hex digits>``, then the summary; the version is a hash of the profile, so it changes when you edit the method.

### Finding user IDs

`allowed_user_ids` and `allowed_delegator_ids` take Linear user IDs (UUIDs), not names or emails. Three ways to find one:

- **From the ticker.** When the ticker declines a delegation or ignores a reply, it writes the person's name and ID to `ticker.log` and shows them in a Herdr notification, for example `acme/DATA-1: not picked up: delegated by Jane Doe (6b7b1cde-...), who is not in allowed_delegator_ids of team DATA` or `acme/DATA-1: ignored a reply from Jane Doe (6b7b1cde-...); add the id to allowed_user_ids of team DATA to let it through`. Copy the ID into the config and run **herdr-linear-agent: reload the config**.
- **From an ignored reply.** A run's `.state/ignored-prompts.md` lists each ignored reply with its sender's ID.
- **From the Linear API.** With a personal API key, post to `https://api.linear.app/graphql`: the query `{ viewer { id name } }` gives your own ID, and `{ users(filter: { email: { eq: "jane@example.com" } }) { nodes { id name } } }` another person's.

### Profiles

Profiles are not in `config.toml`. Each one is a folder next to it, named after the profile, so you can hand a profile to other people as it is: copy the folder, or link it from a repository of shared profiles. A `[profiles]` table in `config.toml` is refused.

```

```

```

kind = "codex"
model = "gpt-6-sol"
effort = "xhigh"
args = ["-s", "workspace-write"]
description = "Changes across modules, bugs with an unknown cause"
```

A profile's `config.toml` takes `kind`, `model`, `effort`, `args`, `description`, `base` and, for routing and postmortem agents only, `env` and `timeout_seconds` (how long a call may take, 1 to 3600 seconds; the limits' default for the role when unset). Folders whose names start with `.` are skipped, other files inside a profile folder (a README, say) are left alone, and any other file directly in `profiles/` is refused. Profile names use letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`.

**Profile inheritance.** `base = "<profile name>"` makes a profile start from another one, so shared settings live in one place and a profile keeps only what differs. A base may have a base of its own (`a` → `b` → `c`), but a profile has one base; a profile that only serves as a base is an ordinary profile. Over the chain, from the root to the profile:

| Field | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `kind` | inherited when left out; a different value than the base's is refused (``profile `a`: kind `codex` differs from its base `b` (`claude`)``), since `args`, `model` and `effort` mean different things per kind |
| `model`, `effort` | replaced when the profile sets them |
| `args` | the whole list is replaced; lists are not joined |
| `env` | the whole table is replaced; keys are not merged, and the routing-agent-only rule applies to the result |
| `description` | never inherited, since the routing agent tells candidates apart by it |
| `instructions.md` | joined, from the root to the profile (see **Profile instructions**) |

A profile cannot unset a value its base sets. A loop (``profile `a`: its base chain loops: a → b → a``) or a base that is not a profile (``profile `a`: base `x` is not a profile``) is refused when the config loads.

```toml
# profiles/claude-base/config.toml: shared by several profiles
kind = "claude"
args = ["--permission-mode", "auto"]
```

```toml
# profiles/standard/config.toml
base = "claude-base"
model = "sonnet"
effort = "high"
description = "Scoped features and fixes"
```

A profile becomes agent CLI flags: `claude` gets `--model` and `--effort`, `codex` gets `-m` and `-c model_reasoning_effort=...`, and any other kind gets `--model` (put the effort in the model ID). `args` are passed unchanged; this is where permission and sandbox flags belong.

**Coordinators on other kinds.** A coordinator reads the run folder's `AGENTS.md`, which Claude Code (through the `CLAUDE.md` link), Codex, Cursor Agent and OpenCode all read. Cursor Agent and OpenCode ran as coordinators in a Herdr pane, before the subagent switches below were added; Codex was not run as a coordinator (see below):

```toml
# profiles/coordinator-codex/config.toml
kind = "codex"
model = "gpt-6-sol"
effort = "high"
args = ["-c", "agents.enabled=false"]    # no subagents of its own (see below)
description = "Coordinator on Codex"
```

```toml
# profiles/coordinator-cursor/config.toml
kind = "cursor"
model = "grok-4.7-medium"                # Cursor has no effort flag: the effort is part of the model ID
args = [
  "--trust",                             # otherwise Cursor asks to trust every new run folder
  "--allowed-tools", "shell_tool_call,read_tool_call,ls_tool_call,glob_tool_call,grep_tool_call",
]
description = "Coordinator on Cursor Agent"
```

```toml
# profiles/coordinator-opencode/config.toml
kind = "opencode"
model = "openai/gpt-6-luna"              # provider/model, as `opencode models` lists it
description = "Coordinator on OpenCode"
```

- Codex asks whether you trust each new run folder, and neither a flag nor a `-c projects...` override skips that dialog (codex-cli 0.156.1), so a Codex coordinator waits in Herdr until someone answers; the answer is saved in your Codex config.
- Cursor Agent asks before it runs a command that is not in its allow-list. The plugin writes `.cursor/cli.json` into each run folder, allowing the plugin's binary by the path the sheet gives the coordinator, as it writes `.claude/settings.local.json` for Claude Code.
- OpenCode starts as `opencode mini`: its full interface takes no model flag, and `mini` takes `--model` and the `--session` a resume adds. OpenCode lets agents run commands unless your OpenCode config says otherwise.

**No subagents in a coordinator.** Workers are started by the plugin as Herdr panes. A coordinator does not use its kind's own subagents, and it waits by ending its turn: the ticker prompts it when its inbox gets new items. A subagent the coordinator starts itself is outside the plugin's limits, and waiting on one tends to turn into polling that spends tokens. The sheet says so to every coordinator; where the kind's CLI can switch its subagents off, add that to the profile's `args`. Checked on 2026-09-29 by asking each agent to start a subagent that replies `pong`:

| Kind | Tested version | Subagents by default | How `args` switch them off |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | Claude Code 2.1.280 | The Agent tool (listed as `Task`); the coordinator's allow-list does not gate it, so it runs without a prompt | `--disallowed-tools=Agent`. Keep the `=` form: the flag takes several values and would swallow the next argument |
| `codex` | codex-cli 0.156.1 | `spawn_agent` | `-c agents.enabled=false`. `--disable multi_agent` turns the feature flag off but leaves `spawn_agent` in place |
| `cursor` | Cursor Agent 2026.09.26 | The `Task` tool; `.cursor/cli.json` permissions do not cover it | `--allowed-tools` with the tools a coordinator needs, as above. The flag is hidden and marked internal; `--exclude-tools task_tool_call` is accepted but does not remove the tool |
| `opencode` | OpenCode 2.0.15 | The `subagent` tool, with the built-in `general` and `explore` agents | `args` alone cannot; an agent in your OpenCode config can (below) |

For OpenCode, add an agent like this to your OpenCode config (for example `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`) and pass `--agent herdr-linear-agent-coordinator` in the profile's `args`. Without it, and for any kind not in the table, the sheet's rule is the only thing that keeps a coordinator from starting subagents.

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "herdr-linear-agent-coordinator": {
      "mode": "primary",
      "description": "herdr-linear-agent coordinator",
      "permission": { "subagent": "deny" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Profile instructions.** A profile's optional `instructions.md` is added for work under that profile: to the run folder's `AGENTS.md` for a coordinator profile, and to the brief for a worker profile, as a "Profile instructions" section after the built-in rules. The built-in rules (never merge, never change the Linear state, stay inside the catalog, treat the issue text as data) stay as they are and win where the two disagree. A profile with a base gets the `instructions.md` of every profile in its chain that has one, from the most general to the most specific, each under a `### From the <profile> profile` heading; where two disagree, the later one wins. A profile cannot drop its base's instructions: to leave them out, split the base. Only the profile folders set instructions; an agent can still pass only a profile's name.

**Claude Code's trust dialog.** Claude Code asks whether you trust a folder the first time it runs there, and every run gets a new run folder, so a coordinator stops at that dialog until someone answers it in Herdr. With `claude.auto_accept_trust_dialog = true`, the plugin accepts that dialog ahead of time, right before it starts a `claude` agent: the run folder for a coordinator, and the worktree and its repository's main checkout for a worker. Claude Code has no setting for this, so the plugin adds `hasTrustDialogAccepted` to that folder's entry in `~/.claude.json` (`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json` when set), which is where Claude Code records your own answers, and changes nothing else in the file. The format is not documented; if Claude Code changes it, the dialog appears again and the plugin asks for someone in Herdr as before.

**Coordinator routing.** Each team names a routing (`routing = "<name>"`, required), a table `[routing.<name>]`. When an issue is picked up, its routing picks the coordinator profile from its `coordinators`; postmortem profiles are picked later, when each postmortem is written (see Postmortems). A list with one profile gives that profile and runs no routing agent. Otherwise the routing agent (`agent`, required only then) gets the candidates' names and descriptions as its instructions, and the issue's title and description, with its estimate, labels and team when known, on standard input, under `limits.routing_agent_timeout_seconds` or its profile's `timeout_seconds`. It must answer `{"coordinator": "<name>"}` (or `{"postmortem": "<name>"}` when picking a postmortem) with a name from the candidates: the schema restricts it where the kind supports one, and the plugin checks the answer against the same schema either way. A timeout, an answer outside the schema, or a name outside the candidates gives the first profile of the list. The Linear thought names the profile and how it was chosen. `agent` must be a profile of a kind listed below; any other kind is refused when the config loads.

### Routing agent kinds

Whatever the issue says, the routing agent can only pick one of the configured candidates, so its context is cut for cost, speed and a steadier choice, not for safety. It runs in a fresh empty folder that is removed afterwards, with your real HOME, config dirs and environment (where the CLIs keep their login), and never with the profile's `args`. Each kind cuts what its CLI lets it cut; the rest remains, as the table says. Measurements are in [docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md).

| Kind | Tested version | Item | How it is cut | Remains, and why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | Claude Code 2.1.280 | Default system prompt | `--system-prompt` with a short fixed instruction | An environment block (working directory, platform, OS version), the model's identity, the account's email and the date, which Claude Code always adds |
| | | Tools | `--tools ""` (only the structured-output tool is left) | |
| | | MCP | `--strict-mcp-config --mcp-config '{"mcpServers":{}}'`, `ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS=false`, `--safe-mode` | |
| | | Skills, slash commands | `--disable-slash-commands`, `--safe-mode` | |
| | | Plugins | `--safe-mode` | |
| | | Hooks | `--safe-mode`, `--restricted` | |
| | | User and project settings | `--setting-sources ""`, `--restricted` | Managed (organization) settings still apply |
| | | Instruction files | `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_MDS=1`, `--safe-mode` (Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` only through a built-in plugin that `--safe-mode` turns off) | The user-level `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` is covered by the same flags but was not tested, to leave your config untouched |
| | | Auto-memory | `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1`, `--safe-mode` | |
| | | Session history and persistence | `--no-session-persistence`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_PROMPT_HISTORY=1` | |
| `codex` | codex-cli 0.156.1 | Default system prompt | `-c model_instructions_file=` with a short fixed file; `include_permissions_instructions`, `include_apps_instructions`, `include_environment_context` set to false | A startup request Codex always sends |
| | | Tools | `--disable` for shell, exec, browser, image, multi-agent and similar features; `-s read-only`; `web_search="disabled"`; `agents.enabled=false` | Two code-mode tool definitions (about 1,350 tokens) that the model's catalog requires; calling them fails because code mode is off |
| | | MCP | `--ignore-user-config` (project config is not loaded either) | |
| | | Skills | `skills.include_instructions=false`, `skills.bundled.enabled=false` | |
| | | Plugins | `--ignore-user-config`, `--disable plugins` | |
| | | Hooks | `--disable hooks` | |
| | | User and project settings | `--ignore-user-config`, `--ignore-rules` | |
| | | Instruction files | `project_doc_max_bytes=0` for project `AGENTS.md` | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (and `AGENTS.override.md`), which Codex always loads from CODEX_HOME |
| | | Auto-memory | `--disable memories` | |
| | | Session history and persistence | `--ephemeral`, `history.persistence="none"` | |
| `cursor` | Cursor Agent 2026.09.26 | Default system prompt | none: Cursor offers no system prompt option; the fixed instruction is the call folder's `AGENTS.md`, which Cursor applies as a rule | Cursor's own system prompt, the user rules synced from your Cursor account, and any `AGENTS.md` or `.cursor/rules` in a folder above the call folder (normally none: it is under the system temp dir) |

**Routing agent environment.** The routing agent's profile may set `env`, variables added to its call (the recipe's own variables win over them). Only that profile may set it: Herdr starts coordinators and workers and cannot pass them variables, so a profile with `env` that is also a coordinator or worker candidate is refused. Its main use is to give a kind an empty config folder of its own where its login does not live there, which cuts what the table above leaves:

```toml
# profiles/router-opencode/config.toml
kind = "opencode"
model = "openai/gpt-6-luna#low"
env = { OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR = "/Users/me/.local/state/herdr-linear-agent/router/opencode" }  # an empty folder you create
```

- `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` replaces the global config folder, so the global `opencode.json`, its MCP servers, plugins and agents, and `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` no longer load. The login lives in OpenCode's database and keeps working.
- `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR` and `CURSOR_DATA_DIR` (the second is undocumented) keep Cursor Agent's chats, projects and settings out of `~/.cursor`; they do not cut prompt tokens, and your default model is not read, so set `model`. The login lives in the Keychain and keeps working. Cursor writes each call's chat into that folder, so empty it now and then.
- Do not point Claude Code's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or Codex's `CODEX_HOME` there: their login lives in those folders.

Cursor Agent and OpenCode have no schema option, so the plugin checks the JSON they print itself (Cursor's `result`, OpenCode's last text event). Put Cursor's effort in the model ID: `model = "grok-4.7-low"`. Put the effort in the model as a variant: `model = "openai/gpt-6-luna#low"`.

Other kinds are not registered.

## How a run works

1. The ticker (a background process the startup hook starts) polls each workspace every 5 seconds (`intake_interval_seconds`) for issues delegated to its app user in the configured teams that are neither completed nor canceled.
2. It checks who delegated each new issue. An issue that someone outside the team's `allowed_delegator_ids` delegated gets no run: the ticker answers its session once, logs the delegator's name and ID and shows a Herdr notification.
3. For a new issue it creates a run folder, creates an Agent Session, posts a first thought, moves the issue to the team's first started state, picks the coordinator profile, and opens a Herdr workspace with the coordinator in the run folder.
4. The coordinator runs `herdr-linear-agent context` every turn, publishes a plan and says why it chose that approach, asks questions, and starts workers with `herdr-linear-agent worker start`. Each worker gets a worktree created by `herdr worktree create` on a branch `herdr-linear-agent/<workspace>/<issue-key>/<id>-<title>`.
5. Workers report what they are doing (`herdr-linear-agent report --activity`) and write a report (`PR: <url>`, `## Report`, `## Next`). The ticker shows each new activity in the session, posts a worker that waits on someone, its report's first paragraph and its pull requests, copies the report into the run folder, and tells the coordinator through its inbox. After 10 quiet minutes it posts what each worker is doing and for how long.
6. Replies in the session from allowed users are appended to `conversation.md` and the coordinator is prompted with one fixed line. A stop signal interrupts the run's agents.
7. `herdr-linear-agent finish` posts the summary and moves the issue to its team's review state once every worker has reported.
8. When the issue is completed or canceled, the ticker stops the agents, closes their workspaces and ends the session with a short response. Checkouts and branches are kept.

When a pane needs a person (a permission or trust dialog), the ticker says so in the session with the pane to go to, and shows a Herdr notification.

## Actions

| Action | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| herdr-linear-agent: log in to Linear | Authorizes each workspace's app without a token in the browser (all of them again when each has one) and stores the tokens in the Keychain or Secret Service |
| herdr-linear-agent: status | Lists the runs, their coordinators and workers |
| herdr-linear-agent: open this run's issue | Opens the issue of the focused pane's run in the browser |
| herdr-linear-agent: focus the run of a Linear issue | Ctrl-click a Linear issue link to focus its run |
| herdr-linear-agent: stop taking new issues | Pauses intake; running runs continue |
| herdr-linear-agent: take new issues again | Resumes intake |
| herdr-linear-agent: check setup | Checks Herdr, the config, the agent CLIs, each workspace's login and the ticker |
| herdr-linear-agent: reload the config | Checks the config and makes the running ticker start its tasks again with it (starts the ticker when none runs) |
| herdr-linear-agent: browse past runs | Opens the past-runs browser over the focused pane (see [Past runs](#past-runs)) |

### Past runs

A run's panes close when it ends. To look back at how a run went, run **herdr-linear-agent: browse past runs**, or `herdr-linear-agent history` in any terminal:

- **The list.** It shows every run of every workspace, the most recently updated first, with its key, the issue title, its state, when it was last updated, and its pull requests. Type to filter it, fuzzy, as in fzf. The right side previews the selected run: `issue.md`, `conversation.md`, each worker's report and the pull requests.
- **Transcripts.** Enter lists the run's coordinator and workers, one line per transcript each left, and shows the selected one: what the agent and the person said, each tool call, and the first lines of each result. It is read-only. Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and OpenCode transcripts are read. The line and the view say whether the text comes from the run folder's copy or from the agent's own files; for a transcript that is gone, the run folder's records are shown instead.
- **Resume.** `r` opens a Herdr workspace in the agent's folder and resumes the selected session there, for kinds that can resume one (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor). It is offered only while the agent is not running and its folder is still there.

Keys: ↑↓ (or Ctrl-p/Ctrl-n) move, PgUp/PgDn (or Ctrl-u/Ctrl-d) scroll the right side, Esc goes back, and Esc on the list, `q` on the transcripts or Ctrl-c quits.

The screens use only the terminal's 16 ANSI colors, so they follow the Herdr theme, dark or light, and change with it. In a transcript the person's messages are green, the agent's blue, tool calls yellow, results gray and errors red.

**Sessions and kept transcripts.** No Herdr agent integration is needed. The plugin records each agent's session itself: it starts Claude Code with a session id it picks (`--session-id`), and finds the session Codex, OpenCode or Cursor began after the start in the agent's folder. So a coordinator whose pane was closed, or a closed run delegated again, resumes its previous session. When a run closes or is detached, and before `worker restart`, the plugin copies each agent's transcript into the run folder (`.state/transcripts/<agent>/<session>.jsonl`, OpenCode's export as `.json`): the agent CLIs may delete their own files later, and the copy stays. It reads Claude Code's `~/.claude/projects` (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects`), Codex's `~/.codex/sessions` (or `$CODEX_HOME/sessions`), Cursor's `~/.cursor/projects`, and `opencode session list` and `opencode session export`, and writes to none of them.

## Files

| Place | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/herdr-linear-agent/config.toml` | Your config |
| `$XDG_STATE_HOME/herdr-linear-agent/runs/<workspace>/<ISSUE-KEY>/` | A run: `issue.md`, `conversation.md`, worker records and reports, the coordinator's inbox, the outbox |
| `$XDG_STATE_HOME/herdr-linear-agent/ticker.log` | The ticker's log |
| `<worktree>/.herdr-linear-agent/<workspace>-<ISSUE-KEY>-<id>/` | A worker's brief and report (see below) |

`$XDG_STATE_HOME` defaults to `~/.local/state` on Linux and macOS alike.

A worker's brief and report live inside its worktree because the worker runs there: sandboxed agents, such as Codex with `-s workspace-write`, can write freely only inside their working directory. To keep that folder out of commits, `worker start` adds `.herdr-linear-agent/` to the repository's `info/exclude`. Every worktree of a repository shares that file with the main checkout, so the rule covers all of them, and it never changes a tracked file such as `.gitignore`. `git add -A`, `git add .` and `git commit -a` all leave the folder out; only a forced `git add -f` would stage it. The ticker copies each report into the run folder (`workers/<id>.md`), so it outlives the worktree.

## Working with other plugins

- Worktree setup and cleanup are left to other plugins. [lamngockhuong/herdr-worktree-setup](https://github.com/lamngockhuong/herdr-worktree-setup) can copy `.env` files and run setup commands for new worktrees. [poislagarde/herdr-worktree-cleanup](https://github.com/poislagarde/herdr-worktree-cleanup) removes clean checkouts when their space closes; add `.herdr-linear-agent/` to its `disposable.gitignore`, or worker checkouts stay.

## Security notes

- Anyone who can delegate an issue in a configured team could otherwise start agents on your machine, so the ticker takes only issues that a person in the team's `allowed_delegator_ids` (default: `allowed_user_ids`) delegated. The delegator is whoever made the latest delegation to the app, as the issue history records it; for an issue delegated as it was created, which leaves no history entry, it is the creator of the Agent Session Linear opened then. Through Linear's Slack integration, that is the person who asked in Slack. The assignee does not count, since anyone can change it before delegating. An issue that automation or another agent delegated, or whose delegator Linear does not tell, is not taken either. A run that was closed or detached starts again only when an allowed person delegates its issue again. The session of a declined delegation gets one response, `This agent does not take issues delegated by this user. Ask someone allowed to delegate it.`, which ends it.
- Agents run as your user. The allow-list the plugin writes for Claude Code and the rules in the coordinator sheet are guidance, not a sandbox: an agent can run any command your shell can.
- `claude.auto_accept_trust_dialog` makes the plugin accept Claude Code's trust dialog for you in its run folders and in worktrees of your catalog repositories. Turn it on only for repositories you already trust.
- The plugin has no subcommand that prints the token. The macOS Keychain may ask for confirmation when a rebuilt binary reads it; a locked Secret Service collection asks to be unlocked.
- The issue text, reports and comments are treated as data. Only replies from the `allowed_user_ids` of the issue's team reach the coordinator as instructions; others are recorded in the run's `.state/ignored-prompts.md` and told in the log and a notification.

## Status

The Linear integration is tested against an in-memory fake of the Linear API. The checks that need a real Linear workspace and a person are listed in [docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md).
