[![Release](https://github.com/civitaspo/herdr-linear-agent/actions/workflows/release-tag.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/civitaspo/herdr-linear-agent/actions/workflows/release-tag.yml)

herdr-linear-agent is a [Herdr](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr) plugin that picks up Linear issues delegated to its Linear app user and works on them with AI coding agents running in Herdr panes.

For each issue, the plugin starts one coordinator agent. The coordinator reads the issue, splits the work, and starts one worker agent per repository in its own Herdr worktree. Workers implement the change, open pull requests and check CI. The plugin reports progress, questions and results to the issue's Linear Agent Session, and people reply there.

- **Linear is the front door.** Delegate an issue to the app user; talk to the run in the issue's Agent Session. There is no public endpoint: the plugin polls Linear.
- **One writer.** Only the plugin's background ticker writes to Linear. Agents call plugin subcommands that queue requests; they never hold a Linear token.
- **Profiles, not flags.** Agent kind, model, effort and permission flags live in profiles you write in the config. Agents choose a profile by name and nothing else.
- **Limits enforced by the binary.** Concurrent runs, workers per run and total agents are capped by the plugin, not by the agents.
- **Nothing is merged for you.** No merge, no force push, and no issue moved to Done. The plugin moves an issue to a started state when it picks it up and to your review state when the coordinator finishes.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux, and Herdr 0.9.1 or later
- On Linux: a Secret Service provider (GNOME Keyring, KWallet) for the token, and `xdg-open`
- The agent CLIs your profiles use (`claude`, `codex`, `cursor-agent`, ...) and `git`
- A Linear workspace where you can install an OAuth application (workspace admin)

## Set up

1. **Create a Linear OAuth application** (Settings → API → OAuth applications) for this plugin. Add the callback URL `http://127.0.0.1:43871/oauth/callback` and note the client ID. The plugin uses the authorization code flow with PKCE and never needs the client secret. It installs the app with `actor=app` and the scopes `read`, `write` and `app:assignable`, which creates an app user you can delegate issues to.
2. **Install the plugin:**

   ```bash
   herdr plugin install civitaspo/herdr-linear-agent
   ```

   The build step downloads the release binary, or builds from source with `cargo` when there is none.
3. **Write the config** at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/herdr-linear-agent/config.toml` (default `~/.config/herdr-linear-agent/config.toml`). See [Configuration](#configuration).
4. **Log in:** run the Herdr action **Linear Agent: log in to Linear**. It opens the browser, stores the token in the macOS Keychain or, on Linux, the Secret Service (service `dev.herdr-linear-agent.linear.oauth.v1`), and checks that it acts as the app user. The browser must run on the same machine: Linear redirects to `127.0.0.1`.
5. **Check the setup:** run **Linear Agent: check setup**.
6. **Delegate an issue** in one of the configured teams to the app user.

## Configuration

```toml
[linear]
client_id = "your-oauth-client-id"
teams = ["DATA"]                         # team keys to pick issues from
allowed_user_ids = ["linear-user-uuid"]  # whose replies reach the coordinator
review_state = "In Review"               # where `finish` moves the issue
# callback_port = 43871

[herdr]
session = "default"                      # the Herdr session runs start in; omit for the default session

[limits]                                 # defaults shown
max_runs = 2
max_workers_per_run = 4
max_agents = 8
run_timeout_hours = 8

[notifications]
herdr = true                             # also show a Herdr notification when a run needs a person

[repositories.api]
path = "/Users/me/src/github.com/acme/api"
base = "main"                            # workers branch from origin/<base>; never guessed
description = "The API server"

[profiles.coordinator]
kind = "claude"
model = "opus"
effort = "high"
args = ["--permission-mode", "auto"]
description = "The default coordinator"

[profiles.coordinator-light]
kind = "claude"
model = "sonnet"
effort = "medium"
args = ["--permission-mode", "auto"]
description = "Coordinator for small issues"

[profiles.router]
kind = "claude"
model = "haiku"
description = "Estimates the size of an unsized issue"

[profiles.standard]
kind = "claude"
model = "sonnet"
effort = "high"
args = ["--permission-mode", "auto"]
description = "Scoped features and fixes"

[profiles.deep]
kind = "codex"
model = "gpt-6-sol"
effort = "xhigh"
args = ["-s", "workspace-write"]
description = "Changes across modules, bugs with an unknown cause"

[routing]
default = "coordinator"
size_label_group = "size"                # labels in this group named XS..XXXL give the size
workers = ["standard", "deep"]           # the profiles a coordinator may start workers with

[routing.agent]                          # optional: size unsized issues with a headless agent
profile = "router"
timeout_seconds = 120

[[routing.rules]]
sizes = ["XS", "S"]
coordinator = "coordinator-light"
```

A profile becomes agent CLI flags: `claude` gets `--model` and `--effort`, `codex` gets `-m` and `-c model_reasoning_effort=...`, and any other kind gets `--model` (put the effort in the model ID). `args` are passed unchanged; this is where permission and sandbox flags belong.

**Coordinator routing.** An issue's size comes from its estimate (the n-th value of the team's scale is the n-th size, XS to XXXL; 0 is XS), then from a size label, then from the routing agent, else it is `unknown`. The first rule whose `sizes`, `teams` and `labels_any` all match picks the coordinator profile; otherwise `routing.default`. The routing agent reads only the issue title and description, on standard input, and may only answer a size.

## How a run works

1. The ticker (a background process the startup hook starts) polls Linear every 30 seconds for issues delegated to the app user in the configured teams that are neither completed nor canceled.
2. For a new issue it creates a run folder, creates an Agent Session, posts a first thought, moves the issue to the team's first started state, picks the coordinator profile, and opens a Herdr workspace with the coordinator in the run folder.
3. The coordinator runs `herdr-linear-agent context` every turn, publishes a plan, asks questions, and starts workers with `herdr-linear-agent worker start`. Each worker gets a worktree created by `herdr worktree create` on a branch `herdr-linear-agent/<issue-key>/<id>-<title>`.
4. Workers write a report (`PR: <url>`, `## Report`, `## Next`). The ticker copies it into the run folder, posts pull requests to the session, and tells the coordinator through its inbox.
5. Replies in the session from allowed users are appended to `conversation.md` and the coordinator is prompted with one fixed line. A stop signal interrupts the run's agents.
6. `herdr-linear-agent finish` posts the summary and moves the issue to the review state once every worker has reported.
7. When the issue is completed or canceled, the ticker stops the agents and closes their workspaces. Checkouts and branches are kept.

When a pane needs a person (a permission or trust dialog), the ticker says so in the session with the pane to go to, and shows a Herdr notification.

## Actions

| Action | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Linear Agent: log in to Linear | Authorizes the app in the browser and stores the token in the Keychain or Secret Service |
| Linear Agent: status | Lists the runs, their coordinators and workers |
| Linear Agent: open this run's issue | Opens the issue of the focused pane's run in the browser |
| Linear Agent: focus the run of a Linear issue | Ctrl-click a Linear issue link to focus its run |
| Linear Agent: stop taking new issues | Pauses intake; running runs continue |
| Linear Agent: take new issues again | Resumes intake |
| Linear Agent: check setup | Checks Herdr, the config, the agent CLIs, the login and the ticker |

## Files

| Place | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/herdr-linear-agent/config.toml` | Your config |
| `$XDG_STATE_HOME/herdr-linear-agent/runs/<ISSUE-KEY>/` | A run: `issue.md`, `conversation.md`, worker records and reports, the coordinator's inbox, the outbox |
| `$XDG_STATE_HOME/herdr-linear-agent/ticker.log` | The ticker's log |
| `<worktree>/.herdr-linear-agent/<ISSUE-KEY>-<id>/` | A worker's brief and report (see below) |

`$XDG_STATE_HOME` defaults to `~/.local/state` on Linux and macOS alike.

A worker's brief and report live inside its worktree because the worker runs there: sandboxed agents, such as Codex with `-s workspace-write`, can write freely only inside their working directory. To keep that folder out of commits, `worker start` adds `.herdr-linear-agent/` to the repository's `info/exclude`. Every worktree of a repository shares that file with the main checkout, so the rule covers all of them, and it never changes a tracked file such as `.gitignore`. `git add -A`, `git add .` and `git commit -a` all leave the folder out; only a forced `git add -f` would stage it. The ticker copies each report into the run folder (`workers/<id>.md`), so it outlives the worktree.

## Working with other plugins

- Worktree setup and cleanup are left to other plugins. [lamngockhuong/herdr-worktree-setup](https://github.com/lamngockhuong/herdr-worktree-setup) can copy `.env` files and run setup commands for new worktrees. [poislagarde/herdr-worktree-cleanup](https://github.com/poislagarde/herdr-worktree-cleanup) removes clean checkouts when their space closes; add `.herdr-linear-agent/` to its `disposable.gitignore`, or worker checkouts stay.
- herdr-linear-agent can run next to herdr-projects: its state directory, branch prefix and pane tokens (`hla_*`) are its own, and it never replaces the Agents view. Remove herdr-projects' progress hooks if they would prime this plugin's agents too.

## Security notes

- Agents run as your user. The allow-list the plugin writes for Claude Code and the rules in the coordinator sheet are guidance, not a sandbox: an agent can run any command your shell can.
- The plugin has no subcommand that prints the token. The macOS Keychain may ask for confirmation when a rebuilt binary reads it; a locked Secret Service collection asks to be unlocked.
- The issue text, reports and comments are treated as data. Only replies from `allowed_user_ids` reach the coordinator as instructions.

## Status

The Linear integration is tested against an in-memory fake of the Linear API. The checks that need a real Linear workspace and a person are listed in [docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md).
